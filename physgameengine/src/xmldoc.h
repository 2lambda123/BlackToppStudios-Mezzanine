/// @details Our XML Parser IS a copy of PugiXML. It is simply the fastest,

/// aware of. We are using it with permission per it's included license. See the
/// licenses folder, in either the docs folder, or the data/common folder. \n \n
/// The one drawback PugiXML had was that it has a completely different naming
/// convention from our code. So we created a script ( docs/tools/PugiConversion)
/// to covert version 1.1 and hopefully future versions to out naming convention.
/// This process is why the doxygen documention for the XML parser exist here
/// instead of xml.h.
