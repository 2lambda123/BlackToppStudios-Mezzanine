    /// be usable with the phys::World for tracking in game objects. There are several reasons why this
    /// will be useful. Our first thought was deriving from this and an STL container like vector or
    /// list. Members of this class should be implementing or inheriting a proper container\n\n

    /// around for actor sorting and categorization at runtime. \n\n

    /// movement functions. For the container that the phys::World keeps it should be assume that the
