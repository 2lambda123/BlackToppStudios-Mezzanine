    /// @details Containers for actors must implement atleast this interface(abstract base class) to
    /// be usable with the phys::World for tracking in game objects. There are several reasons why this
    /// will be useful. Our first thought was deriving from this and an STL container like vector or
    /// list. Members of this class should be implementing or inheriting a proper container\n\n
    /// The phys world will use one of these containers to store all of the actors for tracking purposes
    /// Since  \n\n
    /// In theory you should be be able to work with multiple actor containers and swiftly add or remove
    /// them to ad from a world to quickly control what actors are being worked with. It should even be
    /// possible to remove all actors, or have multiple set of actor in the world if you use the
    /// GameWorldSet methods carefully. \n\n
    /// Additionally the is no reason an actor could be in multiple containers so this can provide even
    /// more options for actor sorting and categorization at runtime. \n\n
    /// Because of this classes representation of a cursor only 1 thread at a time should use the cursor
    /// movement functions. For the container that the phys::World keeps it should be assume that the
    /// cursor is used. For other containers you should manage you container carefully and/or use another
    /// iteration method, such as STL iterators.
