/**
    @file crossplatformexport.h
    @brief This file is used on some platforms to determine what data should be read and written to and from a shared/dynamic library.
    @details Currently this file uses __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport) on the windows platform to control what
    is imported from or exported to the Physgame DLL. If WINDOWS if defined then PHYS_LIB will be set to either "__declspec(dllexport)"
    or "__declspec(dllimport)". Every Class, template, function variable, and other item intended to be in physgame is tagged with
    PHYS_LIB. \n \n

    During compilation of the Physgame engine __declspec(dllexport) tells the compiler that a given item (a function, class, template,
    etc...), should be included in the dll and made available for use in games (or whatever kind of applicaitons use Physgame). This
    header sets PHYS_LIB to __declspec(dllexport) if EXPORTINGPHYSGAMEDLL is set. If Physgame is compiled using the cmake build
    provided then this is handle automatically. If the cmake build is not used, then this file will attempt to detect if the platform
    it is running on is windows or not. It is preferable that you configure your build environment to define WINDOWS and EXPORTINGPHYSGAMEDLL
    if you are compiling this on windows without the provided cmake build. \n \n

    Compilation of applications using Physgame __declspec(dllimport), tells the compiler what to expect from the dll and may make
    optimizations available with some compilers. This is automatically set if you use the cmake build, if you aren't this file will
    attempt to determine if you are running windows. It is best to set the build envirnoment of your game or applciation to define
    WINDOWS, if possible copy of our cmake builds for Catch! or the EngineDemo. \n \n

    The Macro PHYS_LIB is declared as empty if WINDOWS is not defined, as should be the case if LINUX or MACOSX is defined. \n \n
