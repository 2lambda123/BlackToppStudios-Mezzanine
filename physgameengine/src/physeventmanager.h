/// @brief This is a container for Events and facilitates the transfer of data.
/// @details The Event Manager Exists to passed important information about
/// Gamestate from where it is generated to where it is needed. It is the Game
/// Developers option whether they want to grab events directly using the get
/// functions that have filters, or if they want to get all the events at once
/// from a central location and dispatch form there. \n
/// Since all User input comes in the form of events, this is also where user
/// input Polling and optional input sources like Joysticks are controlled
/// from. \n
/// All of these event are stored in an internal Queue and order is preserved.
/// So the First item In will be the First Out (FIFO). This is not strictly a
/// FIFO buffer, there are a number of functions for getting of managing
/// specific kinds of events. Generally these 'Filtered' management functions
/// Still return the first of those kinds of event.
/// @warning Delete pointers you get from this. Anything can create events and
/// Put them here, and anything can get them out, This means the simple way to
/// not cause memory leaks is to have the routines extracting the events delete
/// the events.
/// @warning Currently thi is not thread safe, even though it should be.
