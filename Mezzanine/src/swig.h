/// @brief Used to give commands specifically to the SWIG preprocessor
/// @details SWIG is a C/C++ source code preprocessor that reads source files
/// and produces an implemtation of bindings for that language. Currently it
/// is only used for Lua. It can be used for other items in the future.
/// \n This file defines a number of messages to make troubleshooting SWIG
/// and the script bindings a little easier.
///     - SWIG_INFO_WARN - 999: Warning 990 to 999 are informational messages.
///     - SWIG_INFO_BEGINCLASS - 990: Begining parsing of class.
///     - SWIG_INFO_ENDCLASS - 991: Completing parsing of class.
