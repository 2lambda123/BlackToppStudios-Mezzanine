/// @page ScriptingManual
/// Many scripting languages suitable for being embedded in games have a number of
/// similar traits. All have some kind of runtime that must be initialized, this
/// runtime accepts strings of script source and performs the steps the source
/// desribe. Some keep internal track of the source, others expect the the caller to
/// do so. Most allow passing arguments into scripts and accepting return values.
/// Some allow the script to be compiled to a bytecode and others do not. A scripting
/// manager is a generic interface to this functionality and is expected to be the primary
/// interface for game developers who want to use a given scripting language.
/// @n @n
/// Almost every language makes a point of interoperating with C. Some provide a
/// special Application Prorammer Interface (API - intended for mostly programmers
/// use) for C to call on like Ruby, Lua and AngelScript. Some take advantage of
/// the reliable and unchanging C Application Binary Interface (ABI - primarily
/// for direct executable to executable integration), such as Java, C#,
/// Ruby when using FFI.
/// @n @n
/// In addition to these kinds of complexities, there are different reasons to use
/// a scripting language. The uses cases fall on a spectrum of "Writing a game in
/// a Scripting language with just performance sensitive pieces in C/C++" to the
/// other extreme of "The bulk of the code in C/C++ with the ability to run
/// scripts for flexibilty". The are reasons for both of these use cases and
/// they do not meaningfully conflict. Presumably any extra code written in the
/// more performant C and C++ will benefit all, with the primary reason to not do
/// so being time and technical skill required to do it. If something is already
/// written this way, then why not take advantage of it.
/// @n @n
/// The Interface of the scripting system was an attempt to
/// allow enough flexibility to accomodate most scripting and managed languages,
/// for the purpose of this discussion I mean any language with its own bytecode.
/// @n @n
///
/// The scripting system is included the Mezzanine::Scripting namespace. It is primarily
/// composed of four interface classes, four abstract classes. An implementation of a
/// scripting system should implement these four classes in a sub-namespace:
///     - Mezzanine::Scripting::iScript
///     - Mezzanine::Scripting::iScriptArgument
///     - Mezzanine::Scripting::iScriptingManager
///     - Mezzanine::Scripting::iScriptWorkUnit
///
/// @n @n
/// SWIG ( http://swig.org ) is a tool that generates code in either C or the
/// target language. It gets the information required to do this byreading the
/// Mezzanine source code directly. It support a variety of languages but is
/// currently
///
/// Whether or not the  is updated each build
/// can be controlled by the Mezz_SWIG CMake Flag. When this flag
/// is enabled a SWIG_Mezzanine build target is added to the project. To satisfy
/// build systems this target/project compiles src/blank.cpp as the only files.
/// During the build steps in that target it attempt to Swig from the command line.
/// @n @n
/// This can be run manually by invoking that target specifically. For example:
/// @code
/// $ make SWIG_Mezzanine
/// $ ninja SWIG_Mezzanine
/// @endcode
/// @section CppApiToLua How the C++ API converts to Lua
/// The Documentation for the C++ API is also the canonical documentation for the
/// Lua scripting system. The are some differences those that are not and these
/// detailed on the functions that are different are generalized here.
/// @subsection CApiLuaNamepacesBecomeModules Lua Modules are Related to Namespaces
/// Major namespaces become modules in Lua. You can check on the Lua51ScriptingEngine
/// if there is a function for loading a specific namespace. For example if you want
/// a script to use classes and functions in the Mezzanine::Threading namespace
/// then you will need to load either the safe or the unlimited threading libraries
/// in Lua. This can be done either by passing the right flags to the constructor of
/// the Lua51ScriptingEngine or by calling Lua51ScriptingEngine::OpenMezzanineThreadingLibrary()
/// or Lua51ScriptingEngine::OpenMezzanineThreadingSafeLibrary() . Each Module
/// in Lua stores all of its members in a table of the module's name, and a
/// reference to the table is stored in the Mezzanine table. This is preferred way
/// to call Lua functionality from modules, and calling the table directly may be
/// removed in the future. Here is an example of using a class in the Threading
/// and another in the root namespace:
/// @code
/// bar = MezzanineSafe.Threading.Barrier(4)
/// vec = MezzanineSafe.Vector3(1,1,1)
/// @endcode
/// @n @n
/// @subsection CApiLuaNamespacesFlattened Other Namespaces Are Flattened
/// Namespaces are flattened into the Lua module they are included n:
/// C++ code:
/// @code
/// Mezzanine::Vector3 Vec = Mezzanine::StringTools::ConvertToVector3("3 4 6")
/// @endcode
/// @n @n
/// Lua Code:
/// @code
/// Vec=MezzanineSafe.ConvertToVector3("3 4 6")
/// @endcode
/// @n @n
/// @subsection CApiLuaEnumsFlattened Enums Are Flattened
/// In C++ enumerations might hold values useful in the scope of class. For example
/// the Mezzanine::Exception holds ExceptionCodes that are useful categorizing types
/// of errors. Because each C++ class is represented in Lua as a function that
/// returns a class instance, the syntax "MezzanineSafe.Exception.IO_EXCEPTION" could
/// not work. Enums that are part of a class are instead defined in the same table
/// as the class function and have the class name concatenated to theirs.
/// @n
/// This is different than enums
/// A few example can explain better:
/// C++ code:
/// @code
/// int x = Mezzanine::Exception::IO_EXCEPTION // An enum value on a class
/// int y = Mezzanine::Threading::NotStarted // An enum value in the Threading namespace
/// @endcode
/// @n @n
/// Lua Code:
/// @code
/// x = MezzanineSafe.Exception_IO_EXCEPTION -- flattened to the MezzanineSafe Table/Module
/// y = MezzanineSafe.Threading.NotStarted -- In the Threading table/Module
/// @endcode
/// @n @n
///
///
/// Need to say something about modules in lua
/// datatypes, singleton, vector3, quaternion, and the proxies are likely to be duplicate in multiple places
