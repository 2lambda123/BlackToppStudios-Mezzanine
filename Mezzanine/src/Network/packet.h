        /// @brief A base class for packing information to be transferred over the network.
        /// @remarks Notes about Packets and Fragmentation: @n
        /// When creating packets for any application there should be size considerations.  Routers are permitted to fragment
        /// any packet that it cannot send along to the destination host due to hardware limitations that exist along the path
        /// the packet is taking.  There are some exceptions to this.  In the IPv4 options a flag can be set to disable
        /// fragmentation performed by routers.  In the event that a packet would be fragmented with the flag present the packet
        /// will be dropped and an error sent back saying it couldn't be delivered.  In IPv6 fragmentation simply cannot happen;
        /// it is disabled as per the IPv6 specification and packets are dropped and an error sent back just like with the IPv4
        /// flag.  The error sent back in both cases is often manifested as "Destination Unreachable". @n
        /// So it is important to know how big of a transmission is supported between the local host and the remote host to
        /// facilitate error-free and IP agnostic transmissions, or to just avoid fragmentation altogether that could generate
        /// odd errors if one fragment goes missing.  This is primarily a concern for UDP, which is a "fire-and-forget" protocol
        /// without any redundancy.  However it can still be useful to know for TCP for making some optimizations.  The big terms
        /// in relation to all of this are MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit) and MSS(Maximum Segment Size).  MTU is the maximum total
        /// size of a packet without fragmentation that exists between two hosts.  MSS is very closely related to the MTU and
        /// relates specifically to TCP; it is the maximum size of a single segment of a TCP stream. @n
        /// I mentioned hardware limitations earlier.  Each piece of internetworking equipment can and likely will implement their
        /// own MTU.  So the MTU is highly variable, even when connecting to the same host if it happens to choose a different
        /// path(which can happen even for something simple as the return trip on the same connection).  The more internetworking
        /// devices you encounter the most likely you are to encounter a device with a low MTU.  This is double true for devices
        /// that exist on networks you can't control (I.E. the internet).  Fortunately there are some standards in place that help
        /// us out. @n
        /// There are two things to keep in mind regarding standards relating to MTU, on is the standards relating to the actual
        /// MTU to be set, and the "minimum maximum reassembly buffer size" that must be set that determines the ideal MTU for a
        /// given device.  IETF RFC 1122 states the minimum MTU for IPv4 must be 68.  Likewise, IETF RFC 1122 states the minimum
        /// MTU for IPv6 is 1280.  Both of these standards go on to specify their reassembly buffer sizes to be at least 576 and
        /// 1500, respectively.  These numbers are the recommended minimums for MTU on any connected device.  While these numbers
        /// may be low, they are also the highest that can be expected among devices encountered on the internet.  Real world MTU
        /// can be higher and likely will be in some cases, but there is no hard and fast rules for that.  So the numbers for the
        /// IPv4 and IPv6 reassembly buffers will be our sane defaults prior to any actual detection along a path between
        /// connected hosts. @n
        /// So we have the total size of a transmission, but we're not quite set just yet.  There are headers created by the OS
        /// upon transmission of any given message that take up space in the packet.  So we must take the size of the headers and
        /// subtract that from the values mentioned above.  Both layer 3 and layer 4 protocols have packet headers that count
        /// against us here.  Most of them also have options so their headers are somewhat of a variable length.  The UDP is the
        /// most straightforward, with an 8 byte header and no available options.  TCP is a bit more complicated with a 40 byte
        /// header and depending on options can be up to an additional 40 bytes.  In other words the bulkiest TCP header is 10
        /// times the size of any UDP header!  But still 80 bytes isn't too bad, especially not when you are working with a
        /// reliable protocol such as TCP.  IPv4 and IPv6 is where things get a little weirder.  IPv4 has a simple 20 byte header
        /// and it's options can by up to 40 bytes on top of that, tripling it's size.  The IPv6 header is 40 bytes large, and it's
        /// options are...complicated.  IPv6 changed the packet format so in the core header it defines the next header, which
        /// could be a higher protocol header (such as TCP or UDP) or one of it's options.  Each option header has an identical
        /// field with information on it's offsets.  So options don't have a fixed layout, or really a fixed size, and can be
        /// chained for quite some length.  Unlike the other options values, using the max is just too large and too unrealistic
        /// to factor in.  Instead 40 bytes of space for possible options is a sane value to set aside. @n
        /// The static members that exist on the Packet class exist to help facilitate this math and provide constants to compare
        /// to when creating a message to be packed into a packet.  These values are meant to represent sane defaults to keep your
        /// packets under (in size) in order to avoid delivery complications for transmissions.  It is entirely possible, even
        /// common, for you to be able to sent packets larger than these sizes without experiencing any issues.  This could be
        /// as simple as the options fields for the packets sent aren't used, or the MTU between you and the remote host is much
        /// larger than what is expected here.  In situations where you need to send a transmission larger than the static values
        /// given in those constants, then the MTU should be tested before arbitrarily packing more data into your packets.  Also
        /// keep in mind that these values are intended for internet transmissions, and transmissions over LAN can and will have a
        /// much large MTU in nearly all cases.  Regardless, testing is valuable.
        /// @todo Update this with information on how to manually detect the MTU between local and remote hosts.
