    /// @page Mezzanine Event System
    /// Despite the name of the primary classes involved, the Mezzanine Event system more closely resembles the
    /// Observer Pattern for messaging.  It was designed to be as flexible as possible in common game development
    /// tasks with a number of considerations for speed (although at the time of this writing the system prioritizes
    /// flexibility over speed in situations where one has to be chosen over the other).
    /// @n @n
    /// The primary criteria for the design of the Event System are: @n
    ///     - Scalable. @n
    ///       No forced monolithic design or master publisher.  Objects can arbitrarily use the event
    ///       system classes where they want, be it a simulation object, an application object (such as a
    ///       window), a manager for a subsystem, or (ironically) a monolithic singleton.  Although I don't
    ///       recommend that last one.
    ///     - Modular. @n
    ///       No EventPublisher needs to be aware of any other EventPublisher.  Each EventPublisher is it's own
    ///       contained event ecosystem.
    ///     - Subscribe to specific events. @n
    ///       In most event systems you subscribe to a publisher and receive all of it's events.  With the
    ///       Mezzanine Event System you can subscribe to just one, or however many specific events you are
    ///       interested in.  In some cases this means fewer checks in the callback logic, but it also means
    ///       less time is wasted on uninterested subscribers during event dispatch.
    ///     - Non-Polymorphic Subscribers. @n
    ///       We use templated delegates for event dispatch, not a polymorphic base class.  To be specific, at
    ///       the time of this writing we use std::function.  This allows an extreme amount of versatility in
    ///       subscribers with minimal performance overhead provided you make use of it's small function
    ///       optimization.  Subscribers need only match the signature "void(EventPtr)".
    ///     - Flexible Publisher usage. @n
    ///       Publishers are not interfaces and have no virtual methods.  You are free to inherit from it or
    ///       store it as a data member, whichever is more appropriate.  In fact most of the event system is
    ///       designed without inheritance or virtual methods.  The dispatched events themselves are the one
    ///       exception.
    ///     - No forced binding bookkeeping. @n
    ///       To help with corner cases where both the publisher and subscriber have finite lifetimes we create
    ///       bindings to represent the subscriptions which are returned upon subscription.  This are stored in
    ///       shared_ptr's and your subscribers may hold on to them if needed to check if a publisher exists, or
    ///       can ignore them entirely.
    ///     - Non-Enum Event IDs. @n
    ///       Enums are great, however since publishers are their own event ecosystems, and nothing stops a
    ///       subscriber from subscribing to multiple publishers it would be possible for event enums between
    ///       publishers to have the same value, which can be difficult to sort out in the subscriber logic.
    ///       Instead we use hashed strings (EventNameType) to define our events which are potentially more
    ///       descriptive as well as easier to distinguish and extend than enums.  It can also facilitate
    ///       integration in data driven systems.
    ///     - Flexible Subscriber IDs. @n
    ///       The EventPublisher class will not generate IDs for you.  Ultimately IDs are stored as uintptr_t
    ///       specifically to allow pointers to be used as unique IDs, but this isn't required and doesn't match
    ///       the requirements in all cases.  So you are free to specify whatever identification scheme you wish,
    ///       the only requirement that exists is that the ID be unique to the event subscribed to.
    /// @n @n
    /// As far as messaging schemes go Event/Publisher and Observer are some of the slower ones out there.  There are
    /// many situations where direct messaging or listeners may be more appropriate.  That said, this Event system
    /// excels primarily when you are connecting multiple systems together.  Different systems will have different
    /// requirements for what is passed around and how that is passed into the system.  This Event systems offers that
    /// flexibility.  This IS NOT an answer for all of your messaging needs.  Just the more demanding ones.
    /// @n @n
    /// The usage of the Mezzanine Event System is pretty straightforward.  First you set up the events in the publisher
    /// and then subscribe objects to those events, and when appropriate fire events that occur.
    /// @n @n
    /// Once an EventPublisher is created you should add subscriber tables to it for each event you want it to dispatch.
    /// You do this by calling EventPublisher::AddEventTable(const EventNameType&).  If the named event already exists
    /// then this will return an iterator to the pre-existing table.  Otherwise you'll get an iterator to the created
    /// table, either way you get a valid table.  The underlying implementation does sort the table based on the hash
    /// of the event name AND it does so in a vector.  So there's two reasons to not expect the iterator you are given
    /// to remain valid after multiple insertions.  Once a subscriber table is made via an event name, you are good to
    /// subscribe to that event with the same name.
    /// @n @n
    /// You subscribe to an event by providing the name of the event you want to subscribe to, an ID for the delegate,
    /// and the delegate itself.  If the publisher doesn't have a subscriber table for the named event, an exception
    /// will be thrown.  Otherwise you'll get back a binding you can use or ignore.
    /// @n @n
    /// Firing events is the most manual part.  Some events are simple enough that the event name is descriptive enough.
    /// For those events you just create an EventPtr with the name of the event and call DispatchEvent(EventPtr).  Simple.
    /// If you need to pass additional parameters you are expected to inherit from the Event base class and add the
    /// parameters as data members.  Your subscribers will also need to be aware of the event and perform a cast on
    /// its end to access the parameters.  The steps are mostly identical otherwise.  Construct your custom Event
    /// with the relevant parameters and call DispatchEvent(EventPtr).
    /// @n @n
    /// In general it is expected that either the subscriber or the system the subscriber belongs to will manage the
    /// subscription lifetime.  For some things lifetime isn't a consideration, such as subscribing a non-member
    /// function.  For the situations where it does matter and it's possible the publisher may disappear before
    /// the subscriber, it's a VERY good idea to keep track of the returned binding.  It's also possible to retrieve
    /// a binding from a subscription table using the subscriber ID if you don't want to take it immediately when it's
    /// returned from the Subscribe method.  The binding has a method that will safely check if it is still bound to
    /// publisher.  It also has a convenience method that will unsubscribe it from the bound publisher.
    /// @n @n
    /// There are a few dont's to keep in mind while using the Mezzanine Event System:
    ///     - Due to the use of pointers to publishers (in bindings), it is advised to avoid storing EventPublishers
    ///       where their address may become invalidated.
    ///     - Do not attempt to add/remove subscribers or destroy the publisher/subscription table during the dispatch
    ///       sequence.  The system offers no guarantees that it'll work, although it might.  Robust support for this
    ///       may be added in the future but does not exist at the time of this writing.
    ///     - When using the event system to communicate across multiple threads (or in the context of the Mezzanine,
    ///       across WorkUnits) it is STRONGLY recommended that you store the dispatched Events in a thread-safe Queue
    ///       and process the Events later, instead of trying to process them immediately.  It's far to easy to create
    ///       stalls and/or race conditions otherwise.
