    /// @page Mezzanine Event System
    /// @section EvtOverview Overview
    /// Despite the name of the primary classes involved, the Mezzanine Event system more closely resembles the
    /// Observer Pattern for messaging.  It was designed to be as flexible as possible in common game development
    /// tasks with a number of considerations for speed and flexibility.  The original version of the Mezzanine
    /// Event system was already an extremely flexible system, but made assumptions about the needs of subscription
    /// lifetime management that were forced to always be on.  As such event dispatches often required 5 or 6 pointer
    /// indirections and required overhead, even if you weren't using it.  In the transition to the new system both
    /// of these details were refactored, and much more.  Depending on your configuration an event dispatch can be
    /// done with as few as 2 pointer indirections, or like the old Event system, as many as 6.  Overhead of
    /// subscription lifetime management is entirely optional.  This allowed the Event system to move from being
    /// suitable for communication between subsystems (such as Physics, Graphics, and UI) to something that can be
    /// used in any context, even when the scope is entirely within a single subsystem.
    /// @n @n
    /// The primary criteria for the design of the Event System are: @n
    /// @subsection EvtScalable Scalable
    /// No forced monolithic design or master publisher.  Objects can arbitrarily use the event
    /// system classes where they want, be it a simulation object, an application object (such as a
    /// window), a manager for a subsystem, or (ironically) a monolithic singleton.  Although I don't
    /// recommend that last one.
    /// @subsection EvtModular Modular
    /// No EventPublisher needs to be aware of any other EventPublisher.  Each EventPublisher is it's own
    /// contained event ecosystem.
    /// @subsection EvtSubSpecific Subscribe to specific events
    /// In many event systems you subscribe to a publisher and receive all of it's events.  With the
    /// Mezzanine Event System you can subscribe to just one, or however many specific events you are
    /// interested in.  In some cases this means fewer checks in the callback logic, but it also means
    /// less time is wasted on uninterested subscribers during event dispatch.
    /// @subsection EvtFlexPub Flexible Publisher usage
    /// Publishers are not interfaces and have no virtual methods.  You are free to inherit from it or
    /// store it as a data member, whichever is more appropriate.  In fact, the event system is designed
    /// without inheritance or any virtual methods.  It is entirely possible to end up with virtual
    /// method calls when dealing with subscribers though.  It is not expected or enforced by the system,
    /// but is a sane way to extend the flexibility of how subscribers can interact with the system further.
    /// @subsection EvtBookOptional No forced binding bookkeeping
    /// To help with corner cases where both the publisher and subscriber have finite lifetimes you can
    /// optionally create bindings to represent the subscriptions which are returned upon subscription.  They
    /// are stored in shared_ptr's and interested classes may hold on to them if needed to check if a
    /// publisher exists, or can ignore them entirely.  Alternatively, these can be disabled completely for
    /// a given table or publisher.
    /// @subsection EvtFlexIDs Flexible Event IDs
    /// Enums are an intuitive way to identify specific events efficiently, however since publishers are
    /// their own event ecosystems, and nothing stops a subscriber from subscribing to multiple publishers
    /// it would be possible for event enums between publishers to have the same value, which can be
    /// difficult or impossible to sort out in the subscriber logic.  Event IDs can be whatever type you wish
    /// as they are a type set in a config class that can be overridden/replaced.  We provide a sane default
    /// EventID class that uses hashed strings to define our events which are potentially more
    /// descriptive as well as easier to distinguish and extend than enums.  It can also facilitate
    /// integration in data driven systems.
    /// @subsection EvtSubIDs Flexible Subscriber IDs
    /// Subscriber IDs can be whatever type you wish, as it is a configurable type in a config class.  The
    /// Mezzanine event system does provide a default EventSubscriberID class that is set by default in the
    /// base config class, but this can be overridden/replaced.  Further, the EventPublisher class will not
    /// generate IDs for you.  Ultimately IDs are stored as uintptr_t specifically to allow pointers to be
    /// used as unique IDs, but this isn't required and doesn't match the requirements in all cases.  So you
    /// are free to specify whatever identification scheme you wish, the only requirement that exists is
    /// that the ID be unique to the event subscribed to.
    /// @subsection EvtFlexSubs Flexible Subscribers
    /// Subscribers have only two requirements mandated by the system; have an ID class defined, and a method to
    /// get the ID of an instance.  The method to get the ID, nor anything else on the subscriber, needs to be
    /// polymorphic.  Subscribers can be stored as either values, or pointers.  Any method on the subscriber
    /// can be invoked during event dispatch.  This allows the same system to have an std::function subscriber
    /// (which is provided as FunctionSubscriber) or an interface as a subscriber where each method on the
    /// interface allows more granular event dispatch.
    /// @n @n
    /// @subsection EvtLimits Limits Overview
    /// The Mezzanine Event system is extremely flexible and was designed with several configurations in mind.  The
    /// one caveat to this configuration is that it is in templates and thus must be configured at compile time
    /// rather than runtime.  Additionally, responsibilities in the system are encapsulated in such a way that
    /// functionality can be added to the system to address more specialized use cases as we discover them.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtTableConfig Table Configuration
    /// Configuring the event system begins with the @ref EventSubscriptionTableConfig class.  It contains all the
    /// basic information needed to create an EventSubscriptionTable instance.  If settings need to be changed it's
    /// easiest (and expected) to create a new config class that inherits from EventSubscriptionTableConfig and
    /// redefines the members you want changed with different values.  A very small config class is provided that
    /// does this with a different factory type, the @ref EventBindingTableConfig.  The EventBindingTableConfig
    /// inherits from EventSubscriptionTableConfig and redefines FactoryType with the value of
    /// "SubscriptionFactoryType::SFT_Binding", leaving all other parts of the configuration the same as it was in
    /// EventSubscriptionTableConfig.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtConfigSubs Subscribers
    /// The template parameter "Interface" on EventSubscriptionTableConfig is the subscriber to be set and will be
    /// invoked on event dispatch.  This subscriber can be any value or pointer type.  It can even be an abstract
    /// base/interface class.  If you choose to have a pointer subscriber type, you need to include the "*" in the
    /// template parameter as such:
    /// @n
    /// @code
    /// using TableConfig = EventSubscriptionTableConfig<SubscriberPtr*>;
    /// @endcode
    /// @n
    /// Not including the asterisk will set the system up to store your subscriber type by value instead.  @n
    /// There are two requirements for the subscriber type: @n
    /// 1) A type with the name "IDType" must be defined and it must be equality comparable (==).  @n
    /// 2) A method that returns "IDType" named "GetID()" and is const must be present (it can be pure virtual). @n
    /// No other requirements for the subscriber exist.  It is expected there would be more methods on the subscriber
    /// otherwise event dispatches to that subscriber type would be useless.  There are no expectations or requirements
    /// for those methods.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtConfigFactories FactoryType Config
    /// The EventSubscriptionTableConfig::FactoryType member is an enum value describing the template specialization
    /// that will be used to create subscriptions for the EventSubscriptionTable.  The @ref SubscriptionFactoryType
    /// enum lists the possible values that can be set.
    /// @n
    /// SFT_Subscriber is the default setting and uses the SubscriberType for the subscription.  No extra or special
    /// bookkeeping is attempted and it is ideal for minimal setups or situations where you don't need to track
    /// subscription lifetime.
    /// @n
    /// SFT_Binding will use a factory that will store and return @ref EventSubscriberBinding and/or
    /// @ref EventSubscriberBindingImpl instances, which are designed to help track the lifetime of the subscription
    /// table and subscriber and will invalidate the subscription if either are destroyed.  This process is not entirely
    /// automatic, however.  On the subscriber side it is expected to call @ref EventSubscriberBinding::Unsubscribe
    /// when the subscriber is destroyed or otherwise done listening to events.  If object lifetime is a consideration
    /// for the system using event dispatch, then using SubscriptionFactoryType::SFT_Binding is likely appropriate.  A
    /// convenience struct is provided that sets this (and only this) named @ref EventBindingTableConfig.

    /// @section EvtConfigContainers ContainerType Config
    /// The EventSubscriptionTableConfig::ContainerType member is an enum value describing the template specialization
    /// that will be used to store the subscriptions created by the FactoryType.  The @ref SubscriptionContainerType
    /// enum lists the possible values that can be set.
    /// @n
    /// SCT_Single is intended to store one, and only one, subscriber IF it is a pointer type.  This restriction was
    /// imposed to prevent the need to supply a null or invalid value for the SubscriberType, which may be non-sensical
    /// or inappropriate for many subscriber types.  A separate data member was considered as an alternative to
    /// restricting this container to pointer types, but then it would be too similar to other container specializations
    /// such as the Fixed-Size containers, which are detailed below.
    /// @n
    /// SCT_Unsorted is a sane default container for most configurations, as it doesn't impose a maximum number of
    /// subscribers and makes no attempt to sort them (although they can still be manually sorted using the iterator
    /// access methods available).  It will do it's best to keep it's memory footprint as low as it can given the
    /// subscriber count.
    /// @n
    /// SCT_Unsorted_Fixed will allocate all the space to store subscribers once on construction.  If you know the exact
    /// or close to exact amount of subscribers your system will be using, then this container may improve performance
    /// by reducing the number of allocations the system will make as well as removing one pointer indirection during
    /// event dispatch.  The number of subscribers to allocate for is based on a value specified on the config struct,
    /// which is detailed below.
    /// @n
    /// SCT_Sorted has no maximum subscriber count that it can store, like SCT_Unsorted, but it will sort the
    /// subscriptions based on a provided predicate.  The predicate should be provided as a different member on the
    /// config struct, which is detailed below.  The sorting is intended to control the order in which subscribers
    /// will receive event dispatches.  Direct iterator access is provided, but the ordering should not be tampered with
    /// or assumptions about the ordering made by container may cause it to behave improperly.
    /// @n
    /// SCT_Sorted_Fixed will allocate all the space to store subscribers once on construction, and will keep them sorted
    /// throughout the lifetime of the container.  It has all the same considerations as SCT_Unsorted_Fixed and
    /// SCT_Sorted.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtConfigContainerCount Container Storage Count
    /// The EventSubscriptionTableConfig::StorageCount member is used by Fixed-Size containers to allocate fixed storage
    /// on initialization.  This number defaults to 4, but it is important to keep in mind the intended usage when
    /// determining what is an appropriate storage count as it will allocate space for that many subscribers per table
    /// of that type/configuration.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtConfigContainerPred Container Predicate
    /// The EventSubscriptionTableConfig::StoragePredicate member is used by Sorted containers to keep their stored
    /// subscriptions sorted.  The predicate must be a functor type that can be default constructed, which unfortunately
    /// eliminates lambdas as a possibility.  It's operator() member must take two instances of SubscriberType and
    /// return a bool; true if first should be sorted before second or false otherwise.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtConfigDispatchers DispatcherType Config
    /// The EventSubscriptionTableConfig::DispatcherType member is an enum value describing the template specialization
    /// that will be used to dispatch the events to the subscriptions stored in the subscription container.  The @ref
    /// EventDispatcherType enum lists the possible values that can be set.
    /// @n
    /// EDT_Empty is very basic class with no members or special logic.  It retrieves a range of subscriptions and
    /// dispatches the event to each from beginning to end.  This is a sane default as far as dispatchers go as it has
    /// no memory footprint and has no special features.
    /// @n
    /// EDT_Silencable is almost identical to EDT_Empty, but with the additional feature of having a single bool member
    /// that is checked on each dispatch to allow the dispatch to continue.  By calling SetMuteEvents(const bool) passing
    /// in true on that template specialization it will silence any and all event dispatches until that same method is
    /// called again passing in false.
    /// @n
    /// EDT_Queued is a fairly complex dispatcher and may be required in some multi-threaded configurations.  When an
    /// event is dispatched from the EDT_Queued template specialization it doesn't go directly to the subscriber.  Instead
    /// the information related to that dispatch is stored until a flush method is called.  Only then is the subscriber
    /// notified of the event.  Because of the need to store the dispatch, this is a fairly heavyweight dispatcher,
    /// however this may be required to avoid race conditions that may be otherwise unavoidable.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtConfigDispatchID Dispatch ID
    /// The EventSubscriptionTableConfig::DispatchIDType member is the type used to uniquely identify EventSubscriptionTable
    /// instances.  This type must be less-than comparable (<).  No other requirements exist for this type.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtTableTraits EventSubscriptionTableTraits
    /// EventSubscriptionTableConfig is used by EventSubscriptionTableTraits to generate types and communicate those
    /// types to other classes in the event ecosystem.  You as an end user should never need to interact directly with
    /// EventSubscriptionTableTraits and should only need to be acutely aware of it's existence.  Config classes exist
    /// solely to separate the types that are safe to edit from the types that aren't.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtSubLimits Subscriber Details and Limitations
    /// Subscriber types are given an extreme amount of flexibility in how they are built and what they do.  The
    /// @ref FunctionSubscriber class is provided as a convenience subscriber type that wraps an std::function and provides
    /// the necessary IDType requirements that exist for a subscriber.  This is also provided to help compatibility with
    /// the old Mezzanine Event system.  The FunctionSubscriber can be set up to use any function signature that
    /// std::function can support.
    /// @n
    /// Another versatile setup is to use interface Subscriber types.  That is, to have a abstract base class pointer be
    /// set as the SubscriberType.  The event system expects you to specify the method to be invoked during dispatch
    /// explicitly, so the method can be anything matching the SubscriberType.  This allows you to group up similar events
    /// on either the publisher level by creating multiple subscription tables with IDs corresponding to the event, or
    /// on the subscriber level by creating an interface class with multiple methods that is the grouping of similar events,
    /// or both.  Neither of these options forces the exclusion of the other.  Pointer subscriber types do not need to be
    /// to abstract classes and nothing expects them to be, so you are free to use a pointer to anything if you wish.  Any
    /// method called through the event system cannot be overloaded.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtPub Event Publisher
    /// The EventPublisher class is essentially a glorified EventSubscriptionTable container.  It doesn't perform any
    /// mandatory operation for event dispatch.  If you need multiple tables in one place, it's handy.  However if you have
    /// a setup that doesn't require one, or even requires a different special way of storing your EventSubscriptionTable
    /// instances, you can do that without worry to the rest of the system.  Currently there is only one EventPublisher,
    /// which supports the storage of only one EventSubscriptionTable type, but future plans for the event system involve
    /// expanding the number and versatility of these table containers.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtMultiThread Multi-threading considerations.
    /// The Event system was made with minimal code additions designed to facilitate multi-threaded situations.  Ideally
    /// threading dependencies can be set up to avoid these issues, or event dispatches can be confined to one subsystem
    /// where multi-threading isn't a consideration.  For other situations you will likely need some manner of queueing
    /// for your events.  Queueing can be done either on the EventSubscriptionTable or on the EventSubscriber.  As mentioned
    /// above, a EventDispatcher template specialization is provided to help with EventSubscriptionTable queueing.
    /// EventSubscriber queueing is not provided out-of-box at the time of this writing but is a plan for future expansion
    /// of the Event system.  Creating your own QueuedSubscriber should be as straightforward as saving the parameters of
    /// the event dispatch until it is ready to process it.  The specifics will depend on the chosen design of your
    /// subscriber.
    /// @n @n
    /// @section EvtUsage Using the Event system
    /// Usage of the Mezzanine Event system requires some preparation.  First you need a subscriber type.  Next you need a
    /// config that determines the type of EventSubscriptionTable.  You'll also need some constants that will identify the
    /// EventSubscriptionTable instances you'll be creating.  Keep in mind that unique IDs for EventSubscriptionTable
    /// instances is only enforced within a given EventPublisher.  If you are subscribing to tables within multiple
    /// EventPublishers it's possible to have different tables with the same IDs.  If you pass the table ID as a part of
    /// the event information (as some systems in the Mezzanine do) then you could end up with duplicate IDs if you are
    /// not careful.  This is part of why HashedStrings are used in conjunction with the Event system throughout the Mezzanine,
    /// although this is not required.
    /// @n
    /// If you are using an EventPublisher start by constructing it and calling "AddSubscriptionTable" for each table you
    /// want created.  For simple setups it's fairly intuitive to create one table per event.  If you aren't using an
    /// EventPublisher, then you can just make however many tables you want/need.  Once the tables are made, calling "Subscribe"
    /// passing in an instance of a subscriber to the relevant tables is the last step you need before dispatching.
