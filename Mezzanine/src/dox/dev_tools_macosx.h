    @todo This page need a Mac OS Maintainer

    @section dev_tools_mac_ide IDE - Integrated Development Environment

    @htmlonly<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">@endhtmlonly
    XCode
    @htmlonly</a>@endhtmlonly
    is the de facto IDE on Mac OS X, but
    @htmlonly<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26">@endhtmlonly
    Code::blocks IDE
    @htmlonly</a>@endhtmlonly
    works as well. Installation should be straightforward. In the past there was a problem with one
    of it’s plugins that made it highly unstable. If you are still experiencing this, go in to the
    plugins menu and disable the keyboard shortcut plugin. Overall, codeblocks is less stable on the
    , but it is still usable.

    @section dev_tools_mac_gcc GCC or Clang
    Gcc or Clang are found in the xcode development pack, which should just come with your system,
    but I couldn’t find it so I had to download it from
    @htmlonly<a href="https://developer.apple.com/">@endhtmlonly
     apple’s development site
    @htmlonly</a>@endhtmlonly. You can find it in development tools. You have to register, but it
    there is no monetary cost for it.

    @section dev_tools_mac_git Git
    You can download the latest git for mac from the
    @htmlonly<a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">@endhtmlonly
    Git scm site
    @htmlonly</a>@endhtmlonly.

    @todo Something should be said about sublime text and what about GUIs for git?
