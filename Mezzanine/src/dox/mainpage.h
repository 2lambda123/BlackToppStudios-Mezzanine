    component is the @ref mezzanine_engine. Some components of the can be used on their own, like
    the @ref ThreadingManual "DAGFrameScheduler" a high performance multithreaded replacement for
    single threaded game loops.

    @n Here are some useful links:
    - @ref tech_doc_index
    - @ref blog

    @n
    Currently we are working on a project to modularize the @ref mezzanine_engine. We are calling
    this the Jagati refactor and the project will be split into several
