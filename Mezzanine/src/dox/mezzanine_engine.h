    The %Mezzanine Engine is Framework for building 3d physics enabled video games. It is written in
    and intended for C++ development. The Mezzanine Engine is designed to be re-usable and genre
    agnostic, so that it can be used in as many games as possible.

    @n
    It is released
    under an open source license, the GPLv3 and can readily be used by hobbyists or for educational.
    For licensing without GPL restrictions, including commercial licensing, please

    All of the dependencies are open source as well enabling you or your team to investigate and
    understand every single bit of what our engine is doing.
    @n
    Unlike many other libraries out there we do not expect snooping through source code to be the
    only method of understanding the library. We have rigorously documented all the components of
    our engine and have made available @ref tech_doc_index "Doxygen generated documentation" to help
    you understand our code. We’ve even included a couple extra manuals and articles about some
    higher level usage of parts of our engine, and plan to include more articles for other parts of
    the engine as it is developed and matures.
