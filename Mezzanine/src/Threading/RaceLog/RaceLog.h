/// @brief This class is intended to assiste in troublshooting threading issues with low overhead.
/// @details Race conditions can be difficult to troublshoot. If you have found this then you likely know what a race
/// condition is and can skip past this to the Usage section a few paragraphs below.
/// @n @n
/// Race conditions are subtle bugs that occur when two thread try to access the same resource without correctly
/// ensuring that changes to the resource happen while no other thread is accessing that resource. The most common
/// kind of race is when two or more threads that might reference the same variable and only occasionally change it. If
/// that variable isn't properly synchronized between threads then a huge variety of failures can happen. The variable
/// might be read half in an old state and half in a newer state, the value may be stale even though that appears
/// impossible, the variable may do dynamic allocation internally and leave incorrect pointers in other threads. Even
/// when it looks like code is synchronized it is possible for the Compiler, the operating or the CPU to re-order
/// many kinds of instructions such that events during the actual execution of threads doesn't happen in the order of
/// the source code.
/// @n @n
/// If a programmer is carefully following the C++ memory model or sticking to simple multithreading patterns these
/// classes of bugs can often be avoided. This is not always as simple as it appears. When someone tries to get
/// "clever" without understanding the memory model or when someone tries to creat their own synchronization tools
/// with knowing best practices used in the industry this can lead to subtle bugs that occur only occasionally.
/// @n @n
/// The real change can be something as simple a new optimization added to the compiler. If this optimization presumed
/// your program didn't rely on undefined behavior but unknowing did then there could be a change in thread behavior.
/// The change could be as simply as running the program on a machine with more or fewer cores (or more or less load
/// from other processes). This could change the timing of when resources are accessed, and an the accesses to an
/// improperly synchronized resource might be move all to time in a batch of work.
/// @n @n
/// Whatever the details, the code might have worked 10,000 times and seemed flawless until one day something subtle
/// changed and you are left holding a program that was bug free yesterday but crashes today and there were no code
/// changes.
/// @n @n
/// @b Usage
/// @n This is a replacement for another common tool when fixing bugs, cout. Many threading issues can be isolated by
/// inserting some kind of output statement into the code and capturing that output from a failure. Often a bug will
/// be expressed 1 in a 1,000 runs so the debugging developer will make simple script to run the program 10,000 times
/// and go through the logs attempting to recreate the failure. This often works but can just as oftend mask the bug.
/// output to the console, file or other OS level construct will invoke some kind of synchronization mechanism. thead
/// mutex that is in many cout implementations is sometimes enough to hide a race condition is reasonably fast code.
/// Even tools that do no synchronization intentionally may do some by accident as they log across threads or simply
/// take too much time marshalling log messages.
/// @n
/// This works in a similar way to those but with the lowest overhead possible. Each thread gets its own binary log,
/// and into that it writes one pointer at a time.
