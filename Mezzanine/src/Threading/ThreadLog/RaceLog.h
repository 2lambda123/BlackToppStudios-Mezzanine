    /// race condition is and can skip past this to the Usage section a few paragraphs below.
    /// @n @n
    /// Race conditions are subtle bugs that occur when two thread try to access the same resource without correctly
    /// ensuring that changes to the resource happen while no other thread is accessing that resource. The most common
    /// kind of race is when two or more threads that might reference the same variable and only occasionally change it.
    /// If that variable isn't properly synchronized between threads then a huge variety of failures can happen. The
    /// variable might be read half in an old state and half in a newer state, the value may be stale even though that
    /// appears impossible, the variable may do dynamic allocation internally and leave incorrect pointers in other
    /// threads. Even when it looks like code is synchronized it is possible for the Compiler, the operating or the CPU
    /// to re-order many kinds of instructions such that events during the actual execution of threads doesn't happen in
    /// the order of the source code.
    /// @n @n
    /// If a programmer is carefully following the C++ memory model or sticking to simple multithreading patterns these
    /// classes of bugs can often be avoided. This is not always as simple as it appears. When someone tries to get
    /// "clever" without understanding the memory model or when someone tries to creat their own synchronization tools
    /// with knowing best practices used in the industry this can lead to subtle bugs that occur only occasionally.
    /// @n @n
    /// The real change can be something as simple a new optimization added to the compiler. If this optimization
    /// presumed your program didn't rely on undefined behavior but unknowing did then there could be a change in thread
    /// behavior. The change could be as simply as running the program on a machine with more or fewer cores (or more or
    /// less load from other processes). This could change the timing of when resources are accessed, and an the accesses
    /// to an improperly synchronized resource might be move all to time in a batch of work.
    /// @n @n
    /// Whatever the details, the code might have worked 10,000 times and seemed flawless until one day something subtle
    /// changed and you are left holding a program that was bug free yesterday but crashes today and there were no code
    /// changes.
    /// @n @n
    /// @b Usage
    /// @n This is a replacement for another common tool when fixing bugs, cout. Many threading issues can be isolated
    /// by inserting some kind of output statement into the code and capturing that output from a failure. Often a bug
    /// will be expressed 1 in a 1,000 runs so the debugging developer will make simple script to run the program 10,000
    /// times and go through the logs attempting to recreate the failure. This often works but can just as oftend mask
    /// the bug. output to the console, file or other OS level construct will invoke some kind of synchronization
    /// mechanism. thead mutex that is in many cout implementations is sometimes enough to hide a race condition is
    /// reasonably fast code. Even tools that do no synchronization intentionally may do some by accident as they log
    /// across threads or simplytake too much time marshalling log messages.
    /// @n
    /// This works in a similar way to those but with the lowest overhead possible. Each thread gets its own binary log,
    /// and into that it writes one pointer at a time.
