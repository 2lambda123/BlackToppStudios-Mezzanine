    /// @brief This class is intended to assist in troublshooting threading issues with low overhead.
    /// @details Race conditions can be difficult to troublshoot. If you have found this then you likely know what a
    /// race condition is and can skip past this to the Overview section a few paragraphs below.
    /// @n @n
    /// Race conditions are subtle bugs that occur when two threads try to access the same resource without correctly
    /// ensuring that changes to the resource happen while no other thread is accessing that resource. The most common
    /// kind of race is when two or more threads that might reference the same variable and only occasionally change it.
    /// If that variable isn't properly synchronized between threads then a huge variety of failures can happen. The
    /// variable might be read half in an old state and half in a newer state, the value may be stale even though that
    /// appears impossible, the variable may do dynamic allocation internally and leave incorrect pointers in other
    /// threads. Even when it looks like code is synchronized it is possible for the Compiler, the operating or the CPU
    /// to re-order many kinds of instructions such that events during the actual execution of threads doesn't happen in
    /// the order of the source code.
    /// @n @n
    /// If a programmer is carefully following the C++ memory model or follows simple multithreading patterns these
    /// classes of bugs can often be avoided. This is not always as simple as it appears. When someone tries to get
    /// "clever" without understanding the memory model or when someone tries to create their own synchronization tools
    /// without knowing best practices used in the industry this can lead to subtle bugs that occur only occasionally.
    /// @n @n
    /// The real change can be something as simple a new optimization added to the compiler. If this optimization
    /// presumed your program didn't rely on undefined behavior but unknowingly did then there could be a change in
    /// thread behavior. The change could be as simply as running the program on a machine with more or fewer cores (or
    /// more or less load from other processes). This could change the timing of when resources are accessed, and an the
    /// accesses to an improperly synchronized resource might be move all to time in a batch of work making an error
    /// happen more frequently.
    /// @n @n
    /// Whatever the details, the code might have worked 10,000 times and seemed flawless until one day something subtle
    /// changed and you are left holding a program that was bug free yesterday but crashes today and there were no code
    /// changes.
    /// @n @n
    /// @b Overview
    /// @n This is a replacement for another common set of tools when fixing thread bugs, cout and printf. Many
    /// threading issues can be isolated by inserting some kind of output statement into the code and capturing that
    /// output from a failure. Often a bug will be expressed 1 in a 1,000 runs so the debugging developer will make
    /// simple script to run the program thousands of times and go through the logs attempting to recreate the failure.
    /// This often works but can just as often mask the bug. Output to the console, file or other OS level construct
    /// will invoke some kind of synchronization mechanism. Inside the OS there is only the one buffer to the console or
    /// contents of the file, so the OS must have mutexes, memory fences or some other kind of synchronization to
    /// prevent race conditions in calling code. Sometimes this is enough to hide a race conditions. Even tools that do
    /// no synchronization intentionally may do some by accident as they log to these simplistic resources across
    /// threads or simply take too much time marshalling log messages.
    /// @n
    /// This works in a similar way to those but with the lowest overhead possible. Each thread gets its own binary log,
    /// and into that it writes one pointer at a time. There is never any synchronization called just a call to get the
    /// time and copy a pointer into the log (If your system synchronizes on the time that is really rough, this won't
    /// help you much).
    /// @n
    /// For you to get the full use out of the ThreadLog you will need to insert calls to it in your code and follow the
    /// 4 stages to its use. First, you must initialize it. Second each thread must be registered. Third, Each thread
    /// logs its messages. Fourth and Finally, the contents of the log are aggregated and sorted into chronological
    /// order. This will give you a step by step log of what your application did regardless of however many threads
    /// it is doing that work on.

    /// @b Preparation
    /// @n
    /// @todo Flesh this out
    /// Use @ref ThreadLog::PrepareLogGroup to create a log for each thread and optionally to preallocate space for each
    /// threads log. After setting this more threads cannot be added, the amount passed for the thread count must be
    /// equaly or larger than the actual number of threads. This is because it is impossible to change the layout of the
    /// logging structures without including some kind of synchronization primitive that could alter the behavior of
    /// your code and multiple threads are using this structure to get access to their logs.
    /// @n
    /// The starting space for each thread is much more forgiving. It defaults to 2,000 log entries. Each thread gets
    /// its own std::vector that will store the log. This will expand as more log entries are added. This is possible
    /// because each thread is the only thread that will access its own log. The memory allocations could still cause
    /// accidental synchronizations, to minimize this try to set the log size larger than the amount any single thread
    /// will log.
