This is where the cAudio Shared objects belong. If it they de not exist make sure that the dependencies are install which you can install with the following commands (on ubuntu, other distro users will have to to sift through the immense install command to figure out what they need)
sudo apt-get install openal-dev

Then you just Compile the project like normal and if cAudio needs to be built then a copy will be built and installed into this folder.
