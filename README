This is still in heavy development. if you really must install it, break out your compiler and act like you know what are doing

To compile this from source you will need to compile ogre first and copy the plugins to data/<youyourplatform>/plugins then install code::blocks to open the project then compile it. If it complains about missing libraries, install the appropraite dev package for that library.
