## About ##
The Mezzanine is a multi platform C++ library designed to help create high performance games with:

* 3d Graphics
* 3d Physics
* 3d Sound
* Advanced Threading
* Scripting (Lua only currently)
* XML and XPath

We are creating an tighly integrated API wrapping a number of open source libraries (Bullet3d, Ogre3d, SDL, OpenAL-soft, Ogg, Vorbis, Lua, PugiXML). There seems to be a number of common ways to combine some libraries and number of common ways for a developer using them to shoot themselves. We are following the advice and best practices from all the communities providing this software to try to provide a single clean API.

Much of the features mentioned here are functional and suitable for use in games now, while some functionality is still rough and in development.

Currently Linux, Mac OS X and windows are fully supported.

## Future Goals ##
We have a number of features we are still working on and will not declare a 1.0 version of the library until we have completed most or all of them. Some of these goals include:

* Advanced Game user interface support.
* Simple but robust network support.
* Support for .Net and Ruby interoperation.
* Mobile support.
* And a more stuff that would be tedious to list here.
