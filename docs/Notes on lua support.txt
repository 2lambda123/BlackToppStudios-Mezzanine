For each class we are support in swig/lua


document execeptions from norms
document calling/using class in Lua
test calling soem features with simple unit test


document which operators work in Lua
	cannot be overloaded
		++ and --
		+=,-=,*= etc
		% operator (you have to use math.mod)
		assignment operator
		all bitwise/logical operations
	class external functions will not work

Potentially add functions for the the following operators
	__add__ operator+
	__sub__ operator-
	__mul__ operator *
	__div__ operator/
	__neg__ unary minus
	__call__ operator() (often used in functor classes)
	__pow__ the exponential fn (no C++ equivalent, Lua uses ^)
	__concat__ the concatenation operator (SWIG maps C++'s ~ to Lua's ..)
	__eq__ operator==
	__lt__ operator<
	__le__ operator<=

Heeavily consider adding the following functions which enable better support for Lua features 
	http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/SWIGDocumentation.html#Lua_nn6
	c++ member	->	Lua
	__str__() 	->	tostring(obj)
	__getitem__()
	__setitem__()	->	[] accessor in Lua
