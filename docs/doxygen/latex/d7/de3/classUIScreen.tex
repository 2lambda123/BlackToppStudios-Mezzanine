\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
This class is a helper class for creating UI's. It is responsible for storing and keeping track of all the elements of a single UI screen. UI's can optionally be divided up into Screens, or \char`\"{}pages\char`\"{}. Each screen is batched together for rendering, so keeping the amount of screens to a minimum will improve performance.
