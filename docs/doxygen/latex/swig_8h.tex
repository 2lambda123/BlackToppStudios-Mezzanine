\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
Used to give commands specifically to the S\-W\-I\-G preprocessor. S\-W\-I\-G is a C/\-C++ source code preprocessor that reads source files and produces an implemtation of bindings for that language. Currently it is only used for Lua. It can be used for other items in the future. \par
 This file defines a number of messages to make troubleshooting S\-W\-I\-G and the script bindings a little easier.
