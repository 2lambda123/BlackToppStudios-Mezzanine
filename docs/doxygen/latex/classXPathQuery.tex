A compiled XPath query object.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$xmldoc.h$>$}



\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
A compiled XPath query object. \begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A pointer to the specified \hyperlink{classXPathVariable}{XPathVariable}.
\end{DoxyReturn}
When you call select\_\-nodes with an expression string as an argument, a query object is created behind the scenes. A query object represents a compiled XPath expression. Query objects can be needed in the following circumstances: \par

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can precompile expressions to query objects to save compilation time if it becomes an issue; \par

\item You can use query objects to evaluate XPath expressions which result in booleans, numbers or strings; \par

\item You can get the type of expression value via query object. \par
 \par
 Query objects correspond to xml::XPathQuery type. They are immutable and non-\/copyable: they are bound to the expression at creation time and can not be cloned. If you want to put query objects in a container, allocate them on heap via new operator and store pointers to xml::XPathQuery in the container. \par
 \par
 To evaluate an XPath expression there are a few EvaluatedType functions. According to XPath specification, value of any type can be converted to boolean, number or string value, but no type other than node set can be converted to node set. Because of this, XPathQuery::EvaluateBoolean(), XPathQuery::EvaluateNumber() and XPathQuery::EvaluateString() always return a result, but EvaluateNodeSet results in an error if the return type is not node set.
