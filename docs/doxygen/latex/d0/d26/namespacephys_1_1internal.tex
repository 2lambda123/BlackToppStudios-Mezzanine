This namespace is used for internal helper classes, and in general it should be ignored by game developers.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
This namespace is used for internal helper classes, and in general it should be ignored by game developers. \begin{DoxyInternal}{For internal use only.}
This whole internal namespace is a dirty hack. This is where code goes that must implement classes or functions for the various subsytems the Physgame engine draws on. \end{DoxyInternal}

SDL uses this to filter events it presents to applications. 

\begin{DoxyInternal}{For internal use only.}
This is used used to filter out SQL\_\-quit messages, and generate appropriate messages for the game developer to use. This will always drop quit events, and store that information for later use. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
\item[{\em event}]This is the event SDL expects use to filters, To get real data from this we setup it up so that if the event is a null pointer the function will return data about quit messages \end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Do not use this. It can only cause problems. This is for SDL, the user input subsystem, to filter certain events. 
\end{DoxyWarning}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
This will always return either 0 or 1 to SDL. 0 if it should drop the event, which it does to all SDL\_\-quit events, 1 if the event should be allowed, which it does to all events which are not SDL\_\-quit events. If a null pointer was passed, then this will return 4 if it dropped an SDL\_\-Quit, and 2 if it has not droppped an SDL\_\-quit. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
\end{DoxyInternal}
