Child node iterator (a bidirectional iterator over a collection of \hyperlink{classNode}{Node})  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$xmldoc.h$>$}



\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
Child node iterator (a bidirectional iterator over a collection of \hyperlink{classNode}{Node}) Node::begin() and Node::attributes\_\-begin() return iterators that point to the first node/attribute, respectively; Node::end() and Node::attributes\_\-end() return past-\/the-\/end iterator for node/attribute list, respectively -\/ this iterator can't be dereferenced, but decrementing it results in an iterator pointing to the last element in the list (except for empty lists, where decrementing past-\/the-\/end iterator results in undefined behavior). Past-\/the-\/end iterator is commonly used as a termination value for iteration loops. If you want to get an iterator that points to an existing handle, you can construct the iterator with the handle as a single constructor argument, like so: xml\_\-node\_\-iterator(node). For xml\_\-attribute\_\-iterator, you'll have to provide both an attribute and its parent node.\par
\par
 Node::begin() and Node::end() return equal iterators if called on null \hyperlink{classNode}{Node}; such iterators can't be dereferenced. Node::attributes\_\-begin() and Node::attributes\_\-end() behave the same way. For correct iterator usage this means that child node/attribute collections of null nodes appear to be empty.\par
\par
 Both types of iterators have bidirectional iterator semantics (i.e. they can be incremented and decremented, but efficient random access is not supported) and support all usual iterator operations -\/ comparison, dereference, etc. The iterators are invalidated if the node/attribute objects they're pointing to are removed from the tree; adding nodes/attributes does not invalidate any iterators.
