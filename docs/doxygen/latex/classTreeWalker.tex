\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
Used to call a function for\_\-each member of the subtree of nodes descended from a specific node. \begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
Returns a \hyperlink{classAttributeIterator}{AttributeIterator}.
\end{DoxyReturn}
If you want to do a deep tree traversal, you'll either have to do it via a recursive function or some equivalent method or use a \hyperlink{classTreeWalker}{TreeWalker}. This provides a helper for depth-\/first traversal of a subtree. In order to use it, you have to implement xml::TreeWalker interface and call xml::Node::Traverse() function. \par
\par
 First, TreeWalker::begin() is called with traversal root as its argument.\par
 Then, TreeWalker::for\_\-each() function is called for all nodes in the traversal subtree in depth first order, excluding the traversal root. Each \hyperlink{classNode}{Node} is passed as an argument.\par
 Finally, TreeWalker::end() function is called with traversal root as its argument.\par
\par
 If TreeWalker::begin(), TreeWalker::end() or any of the TreeWalker::for\_\-each() calls return false, the traversal is terminated and false is returned as the traversal result; otherwise, the traversal results in true. Note that you don't have to override begin or end functions; their default implementations return true.\par
\par
 You can get the node's depth relative to the traversal root at any point by calling TreeWalker::Depth() function.
