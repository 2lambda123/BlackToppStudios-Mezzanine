The Doxygen documentation and minor tools to assist with the XML system.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
The Doxygen documentation and minor tools to assist with the XML system. Our XML Parser IS a copy of PugiXML. It is simply the fastest, most stable, most reliable, feature rich, and robust XML parser we were aware of. We are using it with permission per it's included license. See the licenses folder, in either the docs folder, or the data/common folder. \par
 \par
 The one drawback PugiXML had was that it has a completely different naming convention from our code. So we created a script ( docs/tools/PugiConversion) to covert version 1.1 and hopefully future versions to out naming convention. This process is why the doxygen documention for the XML parser exist here instead of \hyperlink{xml_8h}{xml.h}.
