This is used to store information about rotation in 3d space.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is used to store information about rotation in 3d space. This is used to store information about rotation in 3d space. The X, Y and Z are used to identify a ray from the origin (0,0,0), about which W represents an amount of rotation. \begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
