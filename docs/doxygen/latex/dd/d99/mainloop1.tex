The MainLoop is heart of most video games and simulations.\hypertarget{dd/d99/mainloop1_mainloopoverview1}{}\section{Main loop Overview}\label{dd/d99/mainloop1_mainloopoverview1}
The Main loop runs in \hyperlink{classphys_1_1World_af1d9e36d43f5e50543fa2351a32c8362}{World.MainLoop()} which is called by default from \hyperlink{classphys_1_1World_a21cc36be08a61f40619584d4c438936b}{World::GameInit()}. By default this Method also starts the render, the physics andthe input systems. It does very little on it's own. The main loop then calls the PreMainLoopItems(), DoMainLoopItems and PreMainLoopItems(), for each manager in the order of their priority from Lowest to Highest. \par
 Here is a listing of default priorities for each of the managers the a world intantiates by default: -\/50 User Input and events -\/40 Actors -\/30 Physics -\/20 \hyperlink{classphys_1_1Camera}{Camera} -\/10 Lighting (Not yet implemented) 0 Graphics 10 \hyperlink{classphys_1_1Sound}{Sound} 20 Resources
