\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
An XPath node which can store handles to a xml::Node or an xml::Attribute. Because an XPath node can be either a xml::Node or an xml::Attribute, there is a special type, \hyperlink{classXPathNode}{XPathNode}, which is a discriminated union of these types. A value of this type contains two node handles, one of xml::Node type, and another one of xml::Attribute type; at most one of them can be non-\/null. The accessors to get these handles are available: XPathNode::GetNode() an XPathNode::GetAttribute() . \par
 \par
 XPath nodes can be null, in which case both accessors return null handles.
