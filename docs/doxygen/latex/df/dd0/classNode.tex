This is a helper class which non-\/physics objects, such as lights, cameras, ribbon trails, and particle effects may be attached to for enhanced effects.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is a helper class which non-\/physics objects, such as lights, cameras, ribbon trails, and particle effects may be attached to for enhanced effects. This class simply contains a group of functions for easy manipulation of movement and orientation as well as attaching elements to them. This class should only be created through the scene manager. \par
 There are 4 types of nodes: \par
 Center -\/ Works in conjunction with the orbit node and serves as it's center point for the orbit node to rotate around. \par
 Orbit -\/ Counterpart to the Center node, this type does the orbiting. \par
 Stand -\/ Stationary node that points in one direction, that is it. \par
 Free -\/ A node with no rules governing how it moves. \par
 Note: There are no rules restricting the use of nodes anyway, this enum is here simply to help indicate the intended use upon creation.
