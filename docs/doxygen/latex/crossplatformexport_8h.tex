\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is used on some platforms to determine what data should be read and written to and from a shared/dynamic library. Sets up some compiler variables that allow the \hyperlink{namespaceMezzanine}{Mezzanine} to know what platform it is on.

Currently this file uses {\bfseries declspec(dllexport) and \-\_\-\-\_\-declspec(dllimport) on the windows platform to control what is imported from or exported to the \hyperlink{namespaceMezzanine}{Mezzanine} D\-L\-L. If W\-I\-N\-D\-O\-W\-S if defined then M\-E\-Z\-Z\-\_\-\-L\-I\-B will be set to either \char`\"{}$<$/strong$>$declspec(dllexport)\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\-\_\-\-\_\-declspec(dllimport)\char`\"{}. Every Class, template, function variable, and other item intended to be in \hyperlink{namespaceMezzanine}{Mezzanine} is tagged with M\-E\-Z\-Z\-\_\-\-L\-I\-B. \par
 \par
}

{\bfseries During compilation of the \hyperlink{namespaceMezzanine}{Mezzanine} engine \-\_\-\-\_\-declspec(dllexport) tells the compiler that a given item (a function, class, template, etc...), should be included in the dll and made available for use in games (or whatever kind of applicaitons use \hyperlink{namespaceMezzanine}{Mezzanine}). This header sets M\-E\-Z\-Z\-\_\-\-L\-I\-B to \-\_\-\-\_\-declspec(dllexport) if E\-X\-P\-O\-R\-T\-I\-N\-G\-P\-H\-Y\-S\-G\-A\-M\-E\-D\-L\-L is set. If \hyperlink{namespaceMezzanine}{Mezzanine} is compiled using the cmake build provided then this is handle automatically. If the cmake build is not used, then this file will attempt to detect if the platform it is running on is windows or not. It is preferable that you configure your build environment to define W\-I\-N\-D\-O\-W\-S and E\-X\-P\-O\-R\-T\-I\-N\-G\-M\-E\-Z\-Z\-A\-N\-I\-N\-E\-D\-L\-L if you are compiling this on windows without the provided cmake build. \par
 \par
}

{\bfseries Compilation of applications using \hyperlink{namespaceMezzanine}{Mezzanine} \-\_\-\-\_\-declspec(dllimport), tells the compiler what to expect from the dll and may make optimizations available with some compilers. This is automatically set if you use the cmake build, if you aren't this file will attempt to determine if you are running windows. It is best to set the build envirnoment of your game or applciation to define W\-I\-N\-D\-O\-W\-S, if possible copy of our cmake builds for Catch! or the Engine\-Demo. \par
 \par
}

{\bfseries The Macro M\-E\-Z\-Z\-\_\-\-L\-I\-B is declared as empty if W\-I\-N\-D\-O\-W\-S is not defined, as should be the case if L\-I\-N\-U\-X or M\-A\-C\-O\-S\-X is defined. \par
