\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
A tool for serializing classes with specific issues serializing or deserializing them. \hypertarget{d2/d4f/classphys_1_1Serializer_Serialization}{}\subsubsection{Serialization}\label{d2/d4f/classphys_1_1Serializer_Serialization}
The following functions are expected to be implemented on every serializable and deserializable:\par
 \hyperlink{classphys_1_1xml_1_1Node}{xml::Node} ProtoSerialize() const; \par
 void ProtoDeSerialize(const xml::Node\&); \par
 String SerializableName() const; \par
 Implementing these will allow them to work with the Serialize and Deserialize templates defined in \hyperlink{serialization_8h_source}{serialization.h}.

Some classes Must have certain values available at the time of construction. This make serializing them by overwriting an existing class instance impractical. Other classes have private members and it it impractical to change the class to expose this data. In this case a serializer could be made that is the friend of that class so it can do what is required.
