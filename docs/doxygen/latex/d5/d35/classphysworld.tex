This is the main entry point for the entire library. The \hyperlink{classphysworld}{physworld} coordinates and integrates all the underlying subsystems, Currently Ogre3d is used for 3d Graphics, Bullet is used for physics, and SDL is used for user input and window management. Games will need a container for all the playing pieces. It makes sense to tie all of this functionality into one world object.
