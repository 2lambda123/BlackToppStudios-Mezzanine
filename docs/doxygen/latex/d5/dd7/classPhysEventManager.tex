\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is a container for Events and facilitates the transfer of data. The Event Manager Exists to passed important information about Gamestate from where it is generated to where it is needed. It is the Game Developers option whether they want to grab events directly using the get functions that have filters, or if they want to get all the events at once from a central location and dispatch form there. \par
 Since all User input comes in the form of events, this is also where user input Polling and optional input sources like Joysticks are controlled from. \par
 All of these event are stored in an internal Queue and order is preserved. So the First item In will be the First Out (FIFO). This is not strictly a FIFO buffer, there are a number of functions for getting of managing specific kinds of events. Generally these 'Filtered' management functions Still return the first of those kinds of event. \begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Delete pointers you get from this. Anything can create events and Put them here, and anything can get them out, This means the simple way to not cause memory leaks is to have the routines extracting the events delete the events. 

Currently this is not thread safe, even though it should be.
