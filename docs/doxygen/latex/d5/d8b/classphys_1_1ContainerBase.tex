A base class to unify the interface for all game object containers.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$containerbase.h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
A base class to unify the interface for all game object containers. \hyperlink{structThis}{This} interface will be used to allow a more generic way to work with container for game objects such as cameras, actors, constraints and maybe other game objects. \par
\par
 Because of this classes representation of a cursor only 1 thread at a time should use the cursor movement functions. For the container that the \hyperlink{classphys_1_1World}{phys::World} keeps it should be assume that the cursor is used. For other containers you should manage you container carefully and/or use another iteration method, such as STL iterators.
