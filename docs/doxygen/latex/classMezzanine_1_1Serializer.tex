\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$class Serializable$>$ class Mezzanine::Serializer$<$ Serializable $>$}

 This was designed with the idea that a manager could inherit from this or have a separate class that implements this as a member. There should also be no reason why something could not inherit from this and \hyperlink{classMezzanine_1_1DeSerializer}{Mezzanine::DeSerializer}. The type of this template is expected to match what this is serializing.
