\subsection{Detailed Description}
The components to load, save, modify, and use XML will be stored here. This is where objects that help with loading, saving, and manipulating xml documents will reside. This components found here are simply a tight wrapper around TinyXMLcpp with some integration with the rest of the physgame engine to allow some enhanced functionality (like using Ogre's nifty File loading system).\par
