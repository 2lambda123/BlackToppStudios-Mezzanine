rules for wrapping swig
  Primary Tool:
    #ifndef SWIG
    #endif
  each major namespace gets its own module
  actively exclude the std headers
	swig blows up on them
  never exclude datatypes.h
	causes odd problems
	Be careful about what it includes.

  const static POD in a namespace breaks SWIG
