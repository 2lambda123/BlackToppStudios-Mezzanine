Actor
	Both:
		Collision shape:

		Sound Set:

	Raw Serialization:		
		need to (de)serialize a number of Ogre and bullet parts.
			may not be possible to duplicate perfectly
		
	


	Constructor based serialization:
		only need to seriale parts in controller
		can always call constructors same way.

EventCollision
	Needs unique Identifier: used Actor Name
	Needs to use Unique ID to query and find on creation.
		uses actor manager to query for the correct actor pointer.
		throws exception on Failure

Cameras could went into 2 containers
		WorldNodes and CameraManager
		Only deserialized in CameraManager
		Name for camera will stored in WorldNode.
		Camera will store nothing about WorldNode.

Prereqs
	All Attacheable must be deserialized before WorldNodes
	All Actors must be deserialized EventCollisions


Fixed const correctness on Light, Camera, ParticaleEffect, Scenemanager and Attachable
Added Serialization and deserialization support for quaternion.
Cleaned up the way attachables reference WorldNodes
