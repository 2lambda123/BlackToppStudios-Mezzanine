Actor
	Both:
		Collision shape:

		Sound Set:

	Raw Serialization:		
		need to (de)serialize a number of Ogre and bullet parts.
			may not be possible to duplicate perfectly
		
	Constructor based serialization:
		only need to seriale parts in controller
		can always call constructors same way.


EventCollision
	Needs unique Identifier: used Actor Name
	Needs to use Unique ID to query and find on creation.
		uses actor manager to query for the correct actor pointer.
		throws exception on Failure

Camera
	implicity stores cameramanager based on xml location
	Name for camera stored in WorldNode.
	cannot change name after creation, will be done by camera manager
	Camera will store name of WorldNode.
		will not throw exception if node not found. Will expect World node to find it.

Light
	implicity stores scenemanager based on xml location
	name stored in worldnode
	must store type, position, direction, diffusecolour, specularcolour, powerscale,
		if spotlight the 4 attentuation values
		if spotlight 3 angles
			screw if, the logic will be simpler if we just grab them all. I will save if for optimization time, if it is ever needed.
		
WorldNode 
	Will try to find attached members, if it cannot it will assume they will look for it.
		While this should work, it leaves the software with no way to determine if it failed.
		
Prereqs
	All Attacheable must be deserialized before WorldNodes
	All Actors must be deserialized EventCollisions


Fixed some minor documentation issues, Fixed a null pointer dereferencing in camera serialization, and added support for camera serialization
