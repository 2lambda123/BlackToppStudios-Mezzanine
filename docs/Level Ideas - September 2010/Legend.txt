Some spare ideas
Circles of gravity
	maybe they lead to the goal
	maybe they lead back to the start
damping fields that stop foam balls, but lead balls can knock them out.
Use a field and some fancy graphics to make a ball's gravity rotate 90 degrees
a spinn rubber paddle
Pachinko
a field that	
	changes the size of the balls
	changes gold to foam, foam to wood, wood to lead, and lead to gold call it the philosophers field
	that dampens things going in one direction
	a damping feild that changes size when things pass through it.
	turns off gravity
	that makes things glow red then melt ice
use rubber to make and S curve, the player must bounce all the way through.
A rubber basket to catch stuff in.
a compound object shaped like a comb with gold tips the goal is in the recessed base of another matching cone.
